This is a bot to keep scouring for an item to come back in stock at best buy. Currently set up to search for the RTX 3070.

In order for this to work you need a best buy account with everything fully filled out (address, credit cards, etc.) You'll also need to install Selenium. 

Make sure you fill in the info.py file with your username (email), password, and cvv.
